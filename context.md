# SkillSwap – Context Document  
*Last Updated: [29/03/2025]*  

## 🎯 Vision Statement  
Empower learners worldwide to exchange skills peer-to-peer, creating a barrier-free education ecosystem where knowledge is currency.

## 🌟 Core Problem  
1. **Financial Barriers**: 72% of students delay skill development due to expensive courses (Source: ImagineLearning 2023).  
2. **Untapped Potential**: Most people have 3-5 teachable skills but lack platforms to barter them effectively.  

## 💡 Solution  
A dual-sided platform that:  
✅ **Democratizes Learning**: "Trade skills, not dollars"  
✅ **Builds Community**: Verified peer networks  
✅ **Flexible Formats**: 1:1 sessions, group trades, or async skill-sharing
